        <h2>2. The Service</h2>
        <p>
            Barber Pro provides a platform to connect individuals seeking hairstyling and barber services ("Clients") with independent professional barbers ("Barbers"). All services are provided by Barbers, not by Barber Pro. We are a neutral platform and are not responsible for the quality, safety, or legality of the services provided by Barbers.
        </p>
        
        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>
            To use the Application, you must register for an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process. You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for all activities that occur under your account.

        <h2>4. Bookings, Payments, and Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
            Clients can book appointments with Barbers through the Application. The pricing for services is determined by the Barbers. Cancellations are subject to the individual Barber's cancellation policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Barbers, Barber Pro offers a subscription-based service with a free trial period. After the trial period, a subscription fee is required to continue using the platform's features.
        </p>

            <li>Provide false or misleading information.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>

            We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms within the Application.
