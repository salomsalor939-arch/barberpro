        <h1>Terms of Service for Barber Pro</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 08, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By using our mobile application, Barber Pro (the "Application"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Application.
        </p>

        <h2>2. The Service</h2>
        <p>
            Barber Pro provides a platform to connect individuals seeking hairstyling and barber services ("Clients") with independent professional barbers ("Barbers"). All services are provided by Barbers, not by Barber Pro. We are a neutral platform and are not responsible for the quality, safety, or legality of the services provided by Barbers.
        </p>
        
        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>
            To use the Application, you must register for an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process. You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Bookings, Payments, and Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
            Clients can book appointments with Barbers through the Application. The pricing for services is determined by the Barbers. Cancellations are subject to the individual Barber's cancellation policy, which will be displayed at the time of booking.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Barbers, Barber Pro offers a subscription-based service with a free trial period. After the trial period, a subscription fee is required to continue using the platform's features for managing appointments and clients.
        </p>

        <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use the Application to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Post any content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
            <li>Impersonate any person or entity.</li>
            <li>Violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law.</li>
            <li>Provide false or misleading information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these rules.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Account Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            You may request the deletion of your account at any time through the profile settings in the Application. Upon deletion, your data will be removed from our active systems in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
            The Application is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We make no warranty that the service will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. Any disputes are between the Client and the Barber directly.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            In no event will Barber Pro be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising out of your use of the Application or services.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms within the Application. Your continued use of the Application after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
        </p>
